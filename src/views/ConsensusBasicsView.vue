    <h1>Consensus Basics</h1>
    <p style="margin-top: 30px">
      <em>
        For those needing a refresher on the consensus process, here is a
        wonderful explanation of the process provided by professional
        facilitator

    <h5>
      Consensus is a cooperative process in which group members develop and
      agree to support a decision in the best interest of the whole.
    </h5>
    <p>
      <strong>
        Main reasons to use consensus as a decision-making method:
      </strong>
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>High quality decisions</li>
      <li>Builds connection among members</li>
      <li>More effective implementation</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Principles</h3>
    <p class="normal-header">
      <em>
        <strong>
          Cooperation is the basis (we all get more of what we want when we
          cooperate)
        </strong>
      </em>
    </p>
    <p class="bullet1">
      Consensus is for people who are genuinely trying to work together,
      typically based on some shared interest, purpose or calling; OK if some
      interests are divergent, as long as sufficient joint interests are present
    </p>
    <p class="bullet1">
      Search together for the best solution for the group: it's "us against the
      problem" we are trying to solve rather than "us against each other"
    </p>
    <p class="bullet1">
      Recognize that no decision-making system gets everyone their first choice
      all the time
    </p>
    <p class="bullet1">
      What's the creative way to address all the needs present, rather than
      lowest common denominator Skills necessary for consensus are also
      necessary for good relationships
    </p>
    <p class="normal-header">
      <em>
        <strong>Consensus seeks to synthesize the wisdom of the group</strong>
      </em>
    </p>
    <p class="bullet1">
      Unity (different from unanimous vote or everyone's first choice) "Sense of
      the meeting"&mdash;essence is something you can support or are willing to
      let go forward, I can live with it
    </p>
    <p class="bullet1">"Everyone has a piece of the truth"</p>
    <p class="bullet1">
      Value all kinds of input (rational, emotional, kinesthetic, etc.)
    </p>
    <p class="bullet1">
      Consensus is a questioning process, more than an affirming process
    </p>
    <p class="bullet1">
      Goal is to thrash out an issue until a good solution is found, rather than
      make everyone feel good by a fast but fake agreement
    </p>
    <p class="bullet1">
      Encourages lifting everyone up to their highest potential, instead of
      knocking down your opponents
    </p>
    <p class="bullet1">
      Share, question, and learn from each other's experience and thinking
    </p>
    <p class="normal-header">
      <em>
        <strong>
          Remember the spirit and process of the system are even more important
          than the structures
        </strong>
      </em>
    </p>
    <p class="bullet1">
      There is no substitute for being friends with each other
    </p>
    <p class="bullet1">A positive attitude will get you everywhere</p>
    <p class="bullet1">
      Meetings should be fulfilling&mdash;if they're not, then ask why, and
      change it!
    </p>
    <h3>What Helps Consensus Work Well</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>common purpose</li>
      <li>listening</li>
      <li>
        openness to ideas, feelings and experiences of others&mdash;&gt;
        transformative experience, give & take
      </li>
      <li>trust (some degree)</li>
      <li>
        willingness to let go of some of your personal attachments in the best
        interest of the group
      </li>
      <li>
        focus on issues, not personalities&mdash;common ownership of ideas focus
        on interests, not positions, avoid agree/disagree; find reasons or needs
        behind the positions
      </li>
      <li>commitment</li>
      <li>
        time&mdash;enough to work in depth; patience (but if strong common
        purpose may decide quickly)
      </li>
      <li>
        preparation: agenda planning, facilitator prep, bringing materials, etc.
      </li>
    </ul>

        "
    /></a>
    <strong>
      1. Introduction to Issue (by presenter, preferably not the facilitator)
    </strong>
    <p class="bullet1">Why are we talking about this, why does it matter</p>
    <p class="bullet1">History of the issue (including previous meetings)</p>
    <p class="bullet1">
      Goal for this item at this particular meeting (report, decision, committee
      gather input, etc.) Offer as issue or proposal? It depends on the issue.
      For example:
    </p>
    <p class="bullet2">
      If small and simple, proposal may pass with relative ease
    </p>
    <p class="bullet2">
      If small and complex, likely send to committee for main work
    </p>
    <p class="bullet2">
      If large and simple, might be ok to start with proposal, and might take a
      few more meetings, possibly with some committee work in between
    </p>
    <p class="bullet2">
      If large and complex, start with issue not proposal, expect it to take a
      series of meetings, almost always with committee or individual work in
      between
    </p>
    <p class="bullet1">
      At end of initial presentation, others who have factual knowledge of the
      issue are sometimes invited to add in further bits about the history and
      so on&mdash;but don't let this go on too long
    </p>
    <strong>2. Clarifying Questions</strong>
    <p class="bullet1">Questions of understanding only&mdash;short and sweet</p>
    <strong>3. Discussion</strong>
    <p class="bullet1">Further questions</p>
    <p class="bullet1">
      Bring out diversity of ideas, concerns, and perspectives
    </p>
    <p class="bullet1">
      Deal first with values concerns or big picture, before getting into
      details
    </p>
    <p class="bullet1">
      Note agreements and disagreements on general direction and the underlying
      reasons for them&mdash;discuss those underlying reasons and needs
    </p>
    <strong>4. Establish Basic Direction</strong>
    <p class="bullet1">
      What would best serve the whole? Sense of the meeting General or
      philosophical agreement; agreement in principle
    </p>
    <strong>5. Synthesize or Modify Proposal as needed</strong>
    <p class="bullet1">
      Note agreements and disagreements on specifics and the underlying reasons
      for them&mdash;discuss those underlying reasons and needs
    </p>
    <p class="bullet1">Generate ideas to address and resolve concerns</p>
    <p class="bullet1">Evaluate potential solutions</p>
    <p class="bullet1">
      Synthesize proposed ideas/solutions or come up with new ideas in the
      supportive atmosphere of the meeting
    </p>
    <p class="bullet1">
      Stay aware of how much detail the whole group really needs to go into, vs.
      passing to committee
    </p>
    <strong>6. Call for Consensus</strong>
    <p class="bullet1">Re-state proposal clearly</p>
    <p class="bullet1">Ask: "Are there any remaining unresolved concerns?"</p>
    <p class="bullet1">
      Official decision point: Use structure for clarity, such as Agree, Stand
      Aside, Block Check to see if all parties genuinely consent
    </p>
    <strong>7. Record</strong>
    <p class="bullet1">
      Suggest having notetaker read back decision to the group; at least
      re-state for notetaker
    </p>
    <p class="bullet1">Record: decision, tasks, timeline, implementation</p>

    <h3>Decision Point Structure</h3>
    <h5>Agreement (Thumbs Up)</h5>
    <p class="bullet1">Basic alignment with group direction and proposal</p>
    <p class="bullet1">
      Consensus is not the same thing as 100% unanimous vote in majority rule
    </p>
    <p class="bullet1">
      Standard of how much agreement is enough may vary (depending on group and
      item)&mdash;how much agreement is sufficient to achieve solid
      implementation of this proposal? May range from "This is fabulous" to "I
      can live with it for now"
    </p>
    <h5>Standing Aside (Thumbs Sideways)</h5>
    <p class="bullet1">
      A choice to let the group proceed, while personally not feeling aligned
      with direction, based on:
    </p>

    <ul class="bullet1">
      <li>personal values or principles</li>
      <li>
        personal impact or need, e.g. "I can't afford this" or "I'd have to move
        out"
      </li>
      <li>disagreement with group direction</li>
      <li>intuition, not in alignment</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="bullet1">Name in minutes and reason</p>
    <p class="bullet1">
      Not in lead implementation role, but still bound by decision
    </p>
    <p class="bullet1">
      How many is too many? Probably more than 1 (or at most 2). The more you
      allow, the more it's like voting; go too far and you lose the extra
      effectiveness of consensus action.
    </p>
    <h5>Blocking (Thumbs Down)</h5>
    <p class="bullet1">
      Don't do prematurely. Integrate your concerns into discussion early on.
      The following are not valid reasons to block:
    </p>

    <ul class="bullet1">
      <li>
        to get your way or because you prefer a different proposal, or no
        proposal
      </li>
      <li>to fulfill your personal moral values or how you want to live</li>
      <li>tradition; because things have always been done this way</li>
      <li>
        because the proposed action doesn't fit your personal needs (or
        finances)
      </li>
      <li>because you'd have to leave the group if the proposal passed</li>
      <li>to prevent the group from taking a risk</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="bullet1">
      Only do if proposal is disastrous for the group or crosses group's known
      core principles&mdash;then responsible for stopping it
    </p>
    <p class="bullet1">
      Legitimate blocks are most likely to arise from different interpretations
      of a group value, or two group values coming into conflict with each other
    </p>
    <p class="bullet1">
      Inappropriate blocking being the most common cause of dysfunctional
      consensus process, groups benefit from having both cultural and procedural
      ways to address this behavior
    </p>
    <p class="bullet1">Culture-creation may include:</p>

    <ul class="bullet1">
      <li>
        train incoming members in consensus, including what constitutes an
        appropriate block
      </li>
      <li>
        reinforce that anyone who blocks is responsible for helping to work out
        an alternative
      </li>
      <li>
        idea that half a dozen blocks for all your groups is lifetime quota
      </li>
      <li>
        don't allow blocks to prevent the group from continuing to talk about
        the issue
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="bullet1">Procedural responses to blocks may include:</p>
    <ul class="bullet1">
      <li>facilitator overrule</li>
      <li>
        refer unresolved blocks to coordinating committee/steering council for
        possible overrule
      </li>
      <li>only counts if rest of group agrees it's principled</li>
      <li>
        only counts if at least one other group member agrees it's principled
      </li>
      <li>fallback to super-majority vote</li>
      <li>
        requirement that blocker organize meetings with others to work out an
        alternative solution, otherwise group can proceed
      </li>
    </ul>
